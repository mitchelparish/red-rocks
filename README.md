# Red Rocks Park & Amphitheater

This ruby gem scrapes the Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre website and returns the next show on the calendar. Now you'll never have to wonder again, easy-peasy. 

Located 10 miles west of Denver, the open-air amphitheater sits at 6,450 feet above sea level and seats 9,525 people. Utilized as a concert venue since 1906, notable perfomers include The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and The Grateful Dead.
